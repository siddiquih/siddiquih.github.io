	<p>Here below, you will find pictures I have taken from my trips, as well as a short discription
	<img src= "https://i.imgur.com/guiNdwq.jpg" alt="giraffe">
	This is a picture of a giraffe left by a film crew in Kenya.  This animal is very tall.  An intersting fact about the island in which the animals reside is that they overpopulated due to a lack of natural predators.
	<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/LeOVVfG.jpg" alt="baboons">
	This picture of wild baboons was captured in Uganda.  Normally, they are known to be carnivores; however, here they are known to eat vegetation and are occasionally fed by the local residents
	<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/d3j5fWm.jpg" alt="buffalo">
	In this picture, taken in Nairobi, you will see buffalo in the background.  I was cautioned to keep my distance, as they can be very dangerous when approached too closely.
