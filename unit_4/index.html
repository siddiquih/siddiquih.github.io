	<p id="four">This is a picture of a giraffe left by a film crew in Kenya.  This animal is very tall. An intersting fact about the island in which the animals reside is that they overpopulated due to a lack of natural predators.</p>>

	<img class="elephant" src= "https://i.imgur.com/e9f3aNy.jpg" alt="elephant">
	<p id="seven">This image was taken of a bull elephant crossing a rural country side. The bull elephant was leading its heard to eat vegetation in the grass fields. Our driver cautioned us to remain calm and distant from the animals, as any degree of sound or commotion would provoke the animals to attack, as they particularly do not like humans due to a history of poaching for ivory.>
